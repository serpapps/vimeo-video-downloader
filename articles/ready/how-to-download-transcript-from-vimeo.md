## Understanding Vimeo Transcripts {#understanding-vimeo-transcripts}

Before diving into extraction methods, it's important to understand how Vimeo handles transcripts and captions:

### Types of Vimeo Transcripts

**Auto-Generated Captions**: Vimeo automatically generates captions for many videos using speech recognition technology. These are usually less accurate but widely available.

**Manual Captions**: Video creators can upload custom caption files (SRT, VTT, etc.) that are typically more accurate and include proper formatting.

**Embedded Subtitles**: Some videos have hardcoded subtitles that are part of the video file itself and cannot be extracted as text.

**Live Captions**: Real-time transcription during live streams, which may not always be saved.

### Caption File Formats

Vimeo supports several caption formats:
- **WebVTT (.vtt)**: Web Video Text Tracks, the web standard
- **SRT (.srt)**: SubRip format, widely compatible
- **DFXP/TTML**: Advanced timing and styling options
