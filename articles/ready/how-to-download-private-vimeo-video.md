## FAQs {#faqs}

### Q: Is it legal to download private Vimeo videos I have access to?

**A:** Generally yes, if you have legitimate access through proper authentication (passwords, subscriptions, memberships). However, you should respect any usage restrictions and terms of service. When in doubt, ask the content owner for permission.

### Q: Can I download videos from password-protected educational courses?

**A:** If you're enrolled in the course and have been provided the password legitimately, downloading for personal study use typically falls under fair use. However, check the specific course terms and don't redistribute the content.

### Q: Why do some private video download links stop working?

**A:** Private video URLs often include authentication tokens that expire. This is a security feature. You may need to re-authenticate or extract fresh download links. Professional tools handle this automatically.

### Q: What's the difference between unlisted and private videos?

**A:** Unlisted videos can be accessed by anyone with the direct URL but don't appear in search results. Private videos require additional authentication like passwords, logins, or domain restrictions.

### Q: Can I download live streams or time-limited private content?

**A:** Live streams and time-limited content present special challenges. Professional tools offer the best chance of capturing such content, but you must have legitimate access during the available time window.

### Q: How do I know if I'm allowed to download a private video?

**A:** Check if the video owner has enabled downloads, review any terms of service or usage agreements, and consider your legitimate need for the content. When in doubt, ask for permission from the content owner.
