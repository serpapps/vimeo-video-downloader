faqs:
  - question: Is it legal to download Vimeo videos?
    answer: It depends on the video's copyright status and your intended use. Always ensure you have permission or the right to download content. Educational fair use may apply in some cases.
  - question: How to Download restricted Vimeo videos?
    answer: >-
      Video creators can disable downloads. Only Vimeo Plus members and higher can enable/disable this feature for their videos. However, the Vimeo Video Downloader allows you to download Vimeo videos from anywhere, even if the "download" button is disabled.
  - question: Can I download private Vimeo videos?
    answer: Only if you have legitimate access (password, permission, or ownership). Our extension supports private videos when you have proper authorization and are logged in.
  - question: How do I Download a video that cannot be downloaded?
    answer: Use our professional Vimeo downloader browser extension that bypasses download restrictions. The extension can extract video files directly from Vimeo's servers, even when the standard download option is unavailable or disabled by the content creator.
  - question: How can I download multiple videos at once?
    answer: Our browser extension detects videos automatically as you browse. Simply visit each video page and click download, or use the batch functionality to process multiple videos efficiently.
  - question: Does this work with embedded Vimeo videos?
    answer: Yes! Our extension automatically detects Vimeo videos embedded on any website, including course platforms, business sites, and educational portals.
