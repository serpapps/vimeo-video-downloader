## Why did we make this

Well, we made it for ourselves at first.
When we found some solutions to our problems we made a few Youtube videos about them.
And then we found out that other people felt the same way about certain video watching experiences.
And that turned into requests for simpler solutions, more features, etc. So here we are.

**If you've been frustrated with any of these, then we made it for you too:**

- Paid courses disappear before you finish them
- Videos buffer, freeze or fail on slow internet
- Private video links expire without warning
- Need to rewatch videos offline but there's no download button
- Platforms that don’t let you organize lessons
- Courses with good content but terrible video naming
