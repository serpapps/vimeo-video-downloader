# Product Data Files Implementation

This repository now includes the standardized product data structure for SERP Apps downloader products.

## Structure

```
data/
├── product.yml      # Main product configuration following the lander template schema
└── readme.json      # Repository metadata and basic information
```

## Files Created

### `data/product.yml`
- ✅ Complies with the lander template product schema
- ✅ Contains all required fields (slug, seo_title, seo_description, etc.)
- ✅ Includes Stripe configuration for payment processing
- ✅ Includes GHL (GoHighLevel) configuration for lead management
- ✅ Features comprehensive feature list extracted from README
- ✅ Contains 5 screenshot URLs with descriptions
- ✅ Includes FAQ section with Vimeo-specific questions
- ✅ Keywords sourced from brand-assets/resources.md
- ✅ Reviews section with customer testimonials

### `data/readme.json`
- ✅ Contains basic repository metadata
- ✅ Includes topics, language, license information
- ✅ Links to homepage and repository

## Schema Validation

The product.yml file has been validated against the required schema fields:
- ✅ All 8 required fields present
- ✅ Proper YAML structure and syntax
- ✅ Valid URL formats for links
- ✅ Proper nested object structures for Stripe and GHL

## Usage

This structure can be replicated across all downloader repositories in the SERP Apps organization. See:
- `DOWNLOADER_REPOS.md` - List of 29+ downloader repositories
- `scripts/create_product_yml.sh` - Automation script for other repositories

## Next Steps

For implementing across all downloader repositories:
1. Clone each repository individually
2. Run the creation script: `./scripts/create_product_yml.sh <repo-name> <platform-name>`
3. Customize content for each platform
4. Update screenshots, videos, and platform-specific features
5. Set correct Stripe price IDs for each product

## Implementation Status

- ✅ **vimeo-video-downloader** - Complete
- ⏳ **29 other downloader repositories** - Awaiting implementation

Each repository needs individual attention due to platform-specific content and features.
